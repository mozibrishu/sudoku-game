# Development Guide

This document provides detailed information for developers who want to contribute to or understand the Sudoku Master codebase.

## Architecture Overview

The Sudoku Master application follows a modern React architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Core Components

- **App.jsx**: Main application component that manages global state and routing
- **SudokuBoard.jsx**: Renders the 9x9 Sudoku grid with interactive cells
- **NumberPad.jsx**: Provides the number input interface (1-9)
- **GameHeader.jsx**: Displays game information (level, score, time, controls)
- **LevelSelection.jsx**: Main menu for selecting difficulty levels
- **GameComplete.jsx**: Victory screen with final score and statistics
- **PauseScreen.jsx**: Pause overlay with game controls

### P5.js Integration

- **P5Background.jsx**: Manages the animated background effects
- **P5SudokuEffects.jsx**: Handles game-specific visual effects and animations

### Game Logic

- **sudokuLogic.js**: Core Sudoku puzzle generation, validation, and solving algorithms
- **scoring.js**: Scoring system with time-based calculations and achievements
- **antiCheat.js**: Comprehensive anti-cheat system with behavioral analysis

### Custom Hooks

- **useGameState.js**: Central game state management with all game logic
- **useKeyboardControls.js**: Keyboard input handling and shortcuts
- **useUndoRedo.js**: Undo/redo functionality for game moves

## Code Style and Conventions

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow the single responsibility principle
- Use descriptive prop names and include PropTypes when applicable
- Implement proper error boundaries for robust error handling

### State Management

- Use React's built-in state management (useState, useReducer)
- Keep state as close to where it's needed as possible
- Use custom hooks for complex state logic
- Implement proper state normalization for complex data structures

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- Follow the BEM methodology for custom CSS classes
- Use CSS modules for component-specific styles
- Implement responsive design with mobile-first approach

### Performance Optimization

- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Implement proper dependency arrays in useEffect and useCallback
- Use lazy loading for non-critical components
- Optimize P5.js animations with proper frame rate control

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

- Test individual functions and components in isolation
- Use Jest and React Testing Library for component testing
- Mock external dependencies and API calls
- Aim for high code coverage on critical game logic

### Integration Testing

- Test component interactions and data flow
- Verify game state transitions and user workflows
- Test anti-cheat system with simulated user behavior
- Validate scoring calculations across different scenarios

### End-to-End Testing

- Test complete user journeys from start to finish
- Verify game completion and score recording
- Test responsive design across different devices
- Validate accessibility features and keyboard navigation

## Performance Considerations

### P5.js Optimization

- Use efficient drawing methods and minimize canvas operations
- Implement object pooling for particle systems
- Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
- Optimize particle count based on device capabilities

### React Performance

- Minimize unnecessary re-renders with proper memoization
- Use virtual scrolling for large lists (if applicable)
- Implement code splitting for better initial load times
- Optimize bundle size with tree shaking and dead code elimination

### Memory Management

- Clean up event listeners and timers in useEffect cleanup
- Dispose of P5.js resources properly
- Implement proper garbage collection for game objects
- Monitor memory usage during long gaming sessions

## Security Considerations

### Anti-Cheat Implementation

- Client-side validation with server-side verification (when applicable)
- Behavioral analysis to detect automated play
- Rate limiting for API calls and game actions
- Secure storage of game statistics and achievements

### Data Protection

- Implement proper input validation and sanitization
- Use secure methods for storing user preferences
- Protect against XSS and injection attacks
- Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information

## Deployment

### Build Process

- Use Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- Implement proper environment variable management
- Use code splitting and lazy loading for optimal performance
- Generate source maps for debugging in production

### CI/CD Pipeline

- Automated testing on pull requests
- Code quality checks with ESLint and Prettier
- Automated deployment to staging and production environments
- Performance monitoring and error tracking

## Contributing Guidelines

### Code Review Process

- All changes must go through pull request review
- Ensure proper test coverage for new features
- Follow the established code style and conventions
- Update documentation for significant changes

### Issue Reporting

- Use the provided issue templates
- Include steps to reproduce for bug reports
- Provide clear acceptance criteria for feature requests
- Label issues appropriately for better organization

### Development Workflow

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch
2. Implement changes with proper testing
3. Update documentation as needed
4. Submit a pull request with clear description
5. Address review feedback and iterate as needed

## API Documentation

### Game State Management

The `useGameState` hook provides the following interface:

```javascript
const {
  // Game state
  gameState,        // 'menu' | 'playing' | 'paused' | 'completed'
  currentLevel,     // Current difficulty level object
  levels,           // Array of available levels
  
  // Board state
  board,            // 9x9 array representing the game board
  selectedCell,     // Currently selected cell coordinates
  selectedNumber,   // Currently selected number (1-9)
  notes,            // Notes/pencil marks for each cell
  isNoteMode,       // Whether note mode is active
  highlightedNumber,// Number to highlight across the board
  errors,           // Cells with validation errors
  
  // Game metrics
  score,            // Current game score
  time,             // Elapsed time in seconds
  hintsUsed,        // Number of hints used
  mistakes,         // Number of mistakes made
  hintsRemaining,   // Remaining hints available
  
  // Statistics
  statistics,       // Overall game statistics
  
  // Actions
  startGame,        // (level) => void
  makeMove,         // (row, col, num) => boolean
  handleCellClick,  // (row, col) => void
  handleNumberClick,// (num) => void
  getHint,          // () => void
  resetGame,        // () => void
  togglePause,      // () => void
  goToMenu,         // () => void
  setIsNoteMode,    // (boolean) => void
  getRemainingNumbers, // () => object
  getAntiCheatStatus   // () => object
} = useGameState();
```

### Anti-Cheat System

The anti-cheat system provides the following methods:

```javascript
// Track player actions
antiCheat.trackAction({
  type: 'action_type',
  // additional action data
});

// Validate game completion
const validation = antiCheat.validateCompletion({
  difficulty: 'Easy',
  completionTime: 120000,
  correctMoves: 81,
  totalMoves: 85,
  mistakes: 4,
  hintsUsed: 2
});

// Get current status
const status = antiCheat.getStatus();

// Reset for new game
antiCheat.reset();
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **P5.js not loading**: Ensure P5.js is properly imported and the canvas is initialized
2. **Performance issues**: Check for memory leaks in P5.js animations and React components
3. **State synchronization**: Verify that state updates are properly batched and optimized
4. **Build failures**: Check for missing dependencies and proper import statements

### Debugging Tips

- Use React Developer Tools for component inspection
- Enable P5.js debug mode for canvas debugging
- Use browser performance tools to identify bottlenecks
- Implement proper logging for anti-cheat system analysis
